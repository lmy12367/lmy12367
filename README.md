I studied in the School of Software at Hefei University of Technology from September 2018 to June 2022 and was awarded a Bachelor of Engineering degree. During this period, I did an internship in a company in Nanjing from September 2021 to April 2022 to gain relevant experience. My academic efforts and innovative spirit were recognised as evidenced when I received the June 2022 Hefei University of Technology Outstanding Graduation Design Award.
I have a keen interest in the field of computer vision, especially in crowd counting techniques. In addition, during my university years, I also taught myself about STM32 microcontrollers to further expand my knowledge.
